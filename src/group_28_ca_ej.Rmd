```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(here)
library(hexbin)
```

```{r}
# Read in data
ces <- read.csv(here("data", "ces3demographics.csv"))

# Clean up data 
ces_clean <- ces %>% clean_names()
```

```{r}
# Create scatterplot
ggplot(data = ces_clean, aes(x = white, y = ces_3_0_score)) +
  geom_hex() + # Change to 2D geom_hex plot
  labs(x = "White people in community (%)",
       y = "CalEnviroScreen 3.0 score (Increasing Disadvantage)", 
       title = "CalEnviroScreen pollution score for communities with white populations") + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "navy", high = "orange") +
  theme_bw()
```

The figure above shows a negative correlation between between EnviroScreen 3.0 scores for given communities and the percentage of white people within those communities. In other words, as the percentage of white people in a community increases, there tends to be lower EnviroScreen 3.0 scores (less pollution) in the community.
